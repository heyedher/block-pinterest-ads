# Pinterest Ads Block

This repository contains views and explores used for the Pinterest Ads Block dashboards. There are 5 dashboards that come with this block: Pinterest Overview, Pinterest Ads - Clicks, Pinterest Ads - Conversions, Pinterest Ads - Impressions and Pinterest Ads - Spend. Each of the dashboards provides in-depth analysis of ad (pin) & campaign performance over a given timeframe.

This project is remotely included through the Pinterest Ads Block Config project.
To pull updates from this project, update the `ref:` parameter in the manifest file. It should point to the latest commit in [block-pinterest-ads](https://github.com/looker/block-pinterest-ads/commits/master).
